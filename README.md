# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis Project:

The purpose of this project was to analyze the CyBer ride-sharing data to determine differences in rider counts, drivers, and fare mounts across three city types  - Urban, Suburban, and Rural. 

Rider Data and City Data was analyzed and combined to evaluate variances in average fares per driver and average fares per ride for all three city types. 



## Results:


As can be seen in the table below. the total number of rides, total number of drivers, and total fares are highest for urban cities, followed by suburban cities, and rural cities. Given that information, it is expected that the average cost of a fare would be highest for rural customers and that drivers in rural areas make the most per driver and ride. 

### Table 1.

Analysis of the Total Fare by City Type is presented in the chart below. As can be seen, fares for all three city types follow a similar trend over time. The current time period displayed in January 2019 to April 2019. While all cities follow the same trend, demand is clearly highest in urban cities where the greatest amount of fares are gained. However, because of the number of riders, the average rate per ride or driver is lowest. Similar to wait is shown in the table above, rural cities make the least amount of money over the time period.

## Summary

The results of the analysis yield three important recommendations for the CEO addressing disparities among city types. 
1. If the cost of a ride is the same regardless of city type, it is expected that urban cities would have greater ridership and therefore reduce the amount of fare per driver, and the average amount gained by ride. Riders in rural areas are pay almost 3 times the amount of urban riders. That said, it may be beneficial to rural drivers for them to have lower cost rides and for urban riders to pay more since demand is so much greater. 

2. Suburban ridership is interesting in that it presents as a midpoint between urban and rural cities. It is recommended that there be a pilot program to establish a midpoint cost of fare based on suburban data and make the average for all cities equal to the average fare per ride the same for all by setting that fare. 

3. Additional information would be useful in this analysis. Specifically, the date, city, and fare is useful but we may be able to gauge the depth of disparities is we consider the distance of the trip. Short trips should not cost as much as long trip and there may be opportunity to remedy disparities when distance is equal when comparing an urban city ride and a rural city ride.
